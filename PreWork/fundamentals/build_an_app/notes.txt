Issue - resolved:
	- when I first tried to run the rails server then preview it in the browser (Preview: Port 3000) the page had an error of:
		ActiveRecord::PendingMigrationError
		Migrations are pending. To resolve this issue, run: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
		Rails.root: /home/action/workspace/wdi-fundamentals/movies_app
	- this solution worked: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24339902/rails-app-error-activerecordpendingmigrationerror-migrations-are-pending-ru
	- explanation: just run rake db:migrate then start server, see then what happens, looks like existing migrations are yet not part of schema.
