==================
About Me, GA WDI admissions assignment - Build a brand new single-page "About Me" website for yourself inside this new repository, using what you learned from Dash about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your JavaScript code should go inside <script></script> tags inside the <head></head> section of your HTML file; however, your CSS styling should be implemented through an external style sheet. Make sure to include:
	- A section telling us more about you, your experience, and your contact information.
	- A picture of you in the center of the page, and two additional images with captions (one placed in the top right of your page, and one place in the bottom left).
	- An image carousel, with at least 3 images, written in JavaScript. Feel free to use outside resources in addition to the Dash tutorial, and do not be afraid to experiment - have fun with it!
	- Be sure to create all of the necessary files inside the local copy of your GitHub Pages repository! As you work, remember to save your files, add and commit your changes to the repository, and sync everything back to GitHub.com
